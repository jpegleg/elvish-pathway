# The pathway elvish script collection

These scripts use the [dwarven-toolbox](https://github.com/jpegleg/dwarven-toolbox/) tools along with the parallel execution lambdas in elvish to make modular, tweakable, cryptography scripts.

The dwarven-toolkit tools do some of the low level byte operations, while the elvish and CLI does the parallel processing and composability.
